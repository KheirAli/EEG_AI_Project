# Processing-EEG-Signals

EEG signals have a lot of applications in biomedical engineering. In this project which was the final course project on computational intelligence, we had some information about the group of persons and we wanted to detect if they move their right hand or their left hand. We use computational intelligence algorithms to do the project.

At the first, we extracted features from EEG signals, and then by applying a simple one-layer neural network we reach the result of 87% in training with 5-fold training and we reach the result of 75% on the test data.

And another network we trained was the RBF network and we reach 75% accuracy on the test data either.

It is necessary to mention that the test data contains only 40 people and the main challenge in this problem was the lack of sufficient data. For example, even the amount of data was increased by combining real data. The main goal was how we can handle these problems and train a good network.
